; Multi-calendar
; for each bar, all bars of a higher frequency are loaded
; the higher-frequency-bars get grouped into 10 price-groups (divided equally over the range, binned mathematically); 
; bar-volume gets aggregated over the bars highest volume bar is taken. Very similar to a bar-compressor.
; Lower frequency bars imports for each bar the price of biggest volume.
; Based on this 8 alerts are calculated (alert is Boolean column).
