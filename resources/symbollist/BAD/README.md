ETF families

iShares – With more than 100 different exchange traded funds ranging from broad-based to
commodities, the iShares family has the most diverse offering of ETFs. Issued by Barclays
Global Investors, iShares consist of the following types of ETFs: broad-based, international,
industry sector, fixed-income (bonds), and commodities.

PowerShares – Although a relatively newcomer to the ETF scene, we really like the
PowerShares family of exchange traded funds because of the unique way in which they are
comprised. Unlike many other ETF families in which the underlying stocks rarely change, the
PowerShares exchange traded funds use “dynamic indexing” in order to constantly search out the
best performing stocks within each index. Based on a sophisticated quantitative selection
process, “dynamic indexing” enables the underlying securities to change on a quarterly basis.
PowerShares offers ETFs in the broad market, industry sector, and international.

HOLDRS - Issued by Merrill Lynch, HOLDRS is an acronym that stands for HOLding Company
Depositary ReceiptS (pronounced "holders"). Opposite of the PowerShares ETFs, the HOLDRS
only change their underlying components and weightings when a company is acquired. This has
had the unfortunate result over the years of certain companies within each sector developing a
very high percentage weighting within each HOLDR. It is also important to note that the
HOLDRS can only be traded in increments of 100 shares. Nevertheless, the HOLDRS remain
one of the most popular families of ETFs on the market because they were also one of the first.

ProShares - Perhaps the most exciting thing to happen to the world of ETFs since their inception,
the new ProShares family of ETFs enables you to take a bearish stance on the markets while
actually buying an ETF. ProShares ETFs mirror the broad-based indices such as the S&P 500
and Nasdaq, but with an inverse price relationship. As the markets go down, the price of these
ETFs go up (and vice versa). This is a major benefit to those of you who have a retirement
account such as a 401k or IRA because you can effectively sell short the broad market without
having a margin account. In addition, the ProShares family also includes a group of ETFs that
follow the price of the major indices, but are leveraged 2 to 1. You can get more "bang for your
buck" with these, but remember this can work against you as well.

Vanguard – Better known for their diverse selection of traditional mutual funds, Vanguard offers a
well-rounded set of ETFs ranging from broad-based to industry sectors. There are also a few
international ETFs that primarily cover whole continents. There are presently more than 20
different ETFs available for trading and investing.

SPDRs – SPDRS (pronounced "spiders") is an acronym for Standard & Poor's Depositary
Receipts. There are more than 10 different SPDRS issued by State Street Securities or PDR
Services, LLC. Two of the SPDRS track broad-based market indexes, while the rest are
comprised of specific market sectors or industries (known as Select Sector SPDRS). The most
popular is the S&P 500 Index Tracking Stock (SPY), which trades an average daily volume of
over 60 million shares!

StreetTRACKS – Perhaps the most well-known ETF in the StreetTRACKs family is the Gold
Trust (GLD), which mirrors the price of one ounce of spot gold. It was the first exchange traded
fund to track a commodity, but several more from other fund families have since followed. The
StreetTRACKs family also offers ETFs in the broad-based market segments, as well as a handful
of industry sectors.

First Trust – A relative newcomer to the scene, there are presently only a handful of ETFs in this
family, but we included them nevertheless. One of the more interesting funds in this family is the
IPOX-100 Index Fund (FPX), which is tagged to the performance of a wide variety of initial public
offerings (IPOs).

Rydex – The most interesting family of ETFs from Rydex are the CurrencyShares, which track
the price of various foreign currencies versus the U.S. Dollar. It’s a great way to benefit from
currencies trading without messing with the FOREX. Rydex also has a limited offering of ETFs
focused on broad-based market segments such as small, mid, and large cap, as well as growth
and value-specific funds.

WisdomTree – A newcomer to ETFs, Wisdom Tree has launched a family of ETFs whose
underlying stocks are weighted based on how much dividends they pay as opposed to their total
market cap. This is a unique concept that may serve long-term investors well.
